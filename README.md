# 🌸 Educational App for the Bulgarian holydays 🌸

**Festify** is an educational multiplatform app that uses gamification elements
to engage and motivate students in their learning of Bulgarian holidays. It is
an interactive and non-traditional approach to education that presents material
in the form of holidays organized into seasons. The app allows users to earn
points and unlock new lessons as they progress, and offers communication
channels for teachers to engage with their students.
